# Workout Logging App

## Summary
Beginning stages of a python workout logging app. Adding more functionality to it as I work and learn.

## Functionality

Workouts will be organized by workout type (each stored in a different file).
  EX: User: mayjspecer
      Workout type: Legs (stored in legs.txt)
      Exercises: Squats, RDLs, Lunges
      Each exercises having a set. Each set having a weight and rep count.
