# Workout Logging App

## Summary
Beginning stages of a python workout logging app. Adding more functionality to it as I work and learn.

## Purpose
An app to log each workout by exercises, weights, reps, and sets.

Workouts will be organized by workout type (each stored in a different file).

Example:
- User: mayjspecer
- Workout type: Legs (stored in legs.txt)
- Exercises: Squats, RDLs, Lunges
- Each exercises having a set. Each set having a weight and rep count.

## Functionality

### Main
- The program starts with a user login.
- The program offers options to view or edit past workouts, or to create new ones.

### View
- View all content of a specific workout file

### New 
- Creating a new workout is the equivalent of having a day of completely new exercises. 
- This creates a new file and prompts the user for what to fill it with

### Edit 
- Edit allows a user to view the contents of an old workout file and edit individual sets
- This is for when a user is completing a past workout again, but achieves a new weight or rep count in that workout and wants to track their progress.

### Exit
- End the program.
